# tic-80_sources
Original LUA sourcecode of some of my demoscene TIC-80 tiny size intros (64b, 128b, 256b, 512b)

Most of them were packed with some version of [https://github.com/phlubby/pactic](https://github.com/phlubby/pactic) or [https://github.com/vsariola/pakettic](pakettic) to reach final bytesize.
